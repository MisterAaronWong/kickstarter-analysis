## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to advise Louise on the outcomes of other and previous theater campaigns in relation to their launch date as well as previous play campaigns with relation to their monetary fundraising goals. This analysis will help Louise by giving her a better idea of how her own personal play campaign might fare based on previous trends. Analyzing the launch date can give Louise indications on the optimal time for her to begin her fundraiser. Additionally, analyzing the fundraising goal amount can give Louise a better understanding on a reasonable limit she should expect to set her goal limit to in order to maintain the confidence that her campaign will still succeed. To arrive at these conclusions for Louise, the relevant data was filtered. Pivot charts and visuals were created to display the results.
